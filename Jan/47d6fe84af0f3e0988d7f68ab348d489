QUEENS Park Rangers confirmed that Macauley Bonne’s contract has been terminated, freeing him up to move to another club during the January transfer window. The 27-year-old joined the Hoops in 2020 from Charlton Athletic, having scored 11 times in the Championship in the previous season. Bonne, however, has struggled to make an impact at Loftus Road, scoring just three times in 34 appearances in his debut season and was sent out on loan to hometown club Ipswich Town for the 2021-22 campaign. Despite making eight substitute appearances in the Championship this season, Bonne was deemed surplus to requirements by new boss Neil Critchley, and it was always expected that he would move on this month.   However, instead of a loan move or a sale for the Zimbabwe international, QPR have instead opted to mutually part ways with the forward to make it easier for him to find his next move, with his contract set to expire anyway this coming summer.  It’s now time for Bonne to rebuild his career, potentially in League One. At 27 years of age, there is a player in there that can score goals in the third tier, but despite his 11- goal haul for Charlton a few years ago, Bonne hasn’t really looked like a Championship striker. There will probably now be a big rush for his services though in the league below as we know he can hit the back of the net at that level, and it’s good of QPR to free him up to let him make a move. This could also free up some wages for the Hoops to get a new striker of their own in, as it’s a position on the pitch that Critchley really needs to address. — Agencies
