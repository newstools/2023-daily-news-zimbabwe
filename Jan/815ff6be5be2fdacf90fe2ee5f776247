THE Zimbabwe Teachers Association (Zimta) yesterday urged teachers and pupils to take Covid-19 precautions seriously, amid indications of a resurgence of the pandemic. Over 80 students and teachers at three boarding schools in Mashonaland East province recently tested positive for Covid 19, triggering the Zimta alarm. In an interview, Zimta president Richard Gundani said it was important for teachers and students alike to heed all Covid-19 health precautions to safeguard themselves and communities they lived in. “What is important for teachers is to be on high alert. Let us not take Covid to (be) the thing of the past, we are aware of the protocol of Covid-19, and we are supposed to be the educators that lead by example and live a life that follows the protocols of Covid-9 so that we can be on the forefront, that is helping the fight against Covid-19,” he said.  “We play a very important role in schools, communities and so we are supposed to position ourselves so that we prevent another wave of Covid-19 that has already begun.” “Schools are areas of very high concentration of learners, so it is important that schools are not the ones that drive to the next wave,” said Gundani. — New Ziana
