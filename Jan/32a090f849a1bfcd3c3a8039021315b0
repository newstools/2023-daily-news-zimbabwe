SYMPATHY SIBANDAOwn Correspondent EVER since he was a young boy, music was a part of his routine. Sitting around the fire in Masvingo, Prince Munyoro and his family belted out songs in a melody Lucifer would be envious of. Little did young Prince know that he would graduate from being a drumboy to having his own album doubling it as a technical operator at 3Ktv. Going about his business in studio,with audio operations and being behind the camera; his humble demeanour attracts you to know more.  “My career complements my talent as a musician. Growing up we would gather around the fire in the evenings, singing and giving each other turns to lead gospel songs. This helped me to improve on my vocals. “Now, as part of my job I get to link up with many artists who help me with ideas on how to improve my music,” the soft spoken musician explained. With six single tracks to his name, Munyoro is currently basking in glory of his new track titled Confidence. “Confidence, a gospel song with a message of hope was launched on 3ktv and has been received well by different listeners. “My dream is to spread the message of hope to every person ,especially during these difficult times,” Munyoro said. 3ktv provides support and room for self actualisation and being a dream come true for this musician cum technical operator, he continues to count his wins. “I love my job as a technical operator mainly because it was my dream since childhood. “Being part of the trendsetters, helping in the production of quality content is indeed a blessing.” 3Ktv continues to support its own while serving the masses through timeless and quality programming, the only missing link is you and your remote. Channel 293, is where all the fun resides.
