Aston Villa midfielder Marvelous Nakamba is set to join Luton Town on loan for the remainder of the season. The Zimbabwe international is having a medical today ahead of a loan switch to Kenilworth Road. Nakamba was told he can leave Villa this month after a conversation with Unai Emery. The Villa boss spoke with a number of first-team stars earlier this month to inform them that they could find new clubs before the window shuts. Villa have let go of Cameron Archer and Morgan Sanson on loan, while Frederic Guilbert has joined the midfielder in Strasbourg on a permanent contract. Jan Bednarek and Ludwig Augustinsson have both had their loan moves cut short, while Danny Ings joined West Ham in a £15 million switch.  Nakamba hasn’t made a single Premier League appearance this season and will enter the final 12 months of his Villa deal in the summer after first joining the club back in 2019. The 29-year-old’s last appearance for Villa came against Manchester City in the final day of the 2021/22 season as he didn’t feature in any of the club’s cup games this season either. He is yet to score a goal for Villa but played his part in the club’s bid for survival in 2019/20 and also started in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley that year against City. – www.birminghammail.co.uk
