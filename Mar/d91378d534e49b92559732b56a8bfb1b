A REPRESENTATIVE union for civil servants said on Thursday it had rejected a new salary increment offered by the government because it was low. But the Zimbabwe Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions(ZCPSTU) declined to reveal what the government had offered in negotiations this week. In a statement, it said it had demanded that the government come back with a better offer when negotiations resume next week on Thursday. “The workers received an offer from the Government which they disputed, asking the employer to go back and come back with an acceptable offer that speaks to the workers position paper,” ZCPSTU said. In the negotiations, the union was demanding US$840 for its lowest paid member, up from US$540 it previously lobbied for in the past. The government, citing budgetary constraints, consistently refused to give in to the demands for US$540, and instead offered an allowance of US$200 across the board. Now, with the demand for US$840, the gulf between the parties has widened further, making a compromise — let alone agreement — unlikely. “The parties will meet on Thursday 9, March to continue the negotiations,” said ZCPSTU. — New Ziana
