COVID-19 cases continue to increase in the country, with 146 people testing positive on Wednesday, the ministry of Health and Child Care has said. No deaths were recorded, but the new cases were recorded in nine of the country’s 10 provinces, with Midlands being the exception. The new cases brought the cumulative total to 262 709, of which 5 658 have been fatal. Recoveries, however, have been high at 97 percent. The government is still urging people to take precautions such as vaccination, and wearing masks, although it stood down the stringent, mandatory Covid-19 control regime it had put in place at the peak of the pandemic. On Wednesday, a total of 877 people took the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, bringing the cumulative figure to 6.6 million. On the same day, 639 others took the second dose, taking the total to date to 4.9 million.  Third dose takers totalled 1 449, bringing the cumulative figure to 1.3 million. “The Covid-19 vaccination, which was introduced in March 2021, is still continuing until all eligible people are vaccinated and protected,” the ministry said. “The service remains available at all health facilities when there are no mass vaccination campaigns. From time to time, the ministry of Health and Child Care conducts mass vaccination campaigns in different communities,” it added. — New Ziana
