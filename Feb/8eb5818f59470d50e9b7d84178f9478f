THE World Health Organisation (WHO) Zimbabwe has warned the public to be on high alert for cholera following an outbreak in the Sadc region. The warning also comes after Health authorities in Zimbabwe have detected two cholera cases in Chegutu, Mashonaland West province, with one having been confirmed and another still under investigation. “Zimbabwe recorded its first cholera case on the 15th of February 2023. “We urge the public to be on high alert for symptoms of watery diarrhoea and present themselves to the nearest health facility if experiencing any,” said the WHO. Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease caused by the germ vibrio Cholera and it is characterized by severe watery diarrhoea and vomiting. The ministry of Health has declared a state of vigilance to the population and requested everyone to be involved in stopping the spread of the outbreak. The bulk of new cases and deaths have been recorded in Malawi, which is facing its worst cholera outbreak in two decades. Malawi’s neighbours Mozambique and Zambia have also recently reported cases. Cholera is an acute, extremely virulent infection that can spread rapidly, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The disease is however, easily treatable with most people being treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution or intravenous fluids. — New Ziana
