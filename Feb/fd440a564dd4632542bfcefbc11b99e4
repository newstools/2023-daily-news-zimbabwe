This year a series of Financial Literacy workshops have been scheduled aiming to continue furnishing artists with knowledge on how best they can handle their finances investing into both now and the future so that they are financially prepared for life during and after fame.The key areas of focus that are taught to artists using Old Mutual’s On The Money program are Financial Planning, Savings, Budgeting, Managing Debt, and Investing.NAMAs are designed to recognize outstanding achievements within the arts sector and Old Mutual augments with financial literacy programs. Empowerment of this nature will allow our artists to exploit financial products to their advantage and sharpen their saving, budgeting, and investment skills.
